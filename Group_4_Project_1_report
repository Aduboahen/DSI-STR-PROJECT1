Provide a genetic diagnosis for one patient by identifying a disease-associated repeat expansion in the pathogenic range.

1. Identify 3 patients with intermediate range disease-associated repeat expansions.

2. Provide a visualization of all 4 of the identified disease-associated REs clearly showing the read support for each allele.

3. Provide some feedback for the Neurology Department regarding the following queries:
        a. Are you sure these REs are real? Do you suggest we validate them by any other method?
        b. How confident are you in the size of the expanded repeats? Is your analysis accurate?
        
4. Do you think we could offer RE testing as a diagnostic service in our clinic using whole genome sequencing data? Can you foresee any challenges or important things we need to consider?
        
        

5. Where did you get your reference ranges from? Are these ranges valid in African populations?
STRipy
        
        
        
6. Can we use whole exome sequencing (WES) data to analyse REs? The start-up company has offered WES to us at a very good price but WGS is unfortunately not within our budget.

WES can be used to analyse REs if we are looking at a specific RE that is known to be in the exomic region.
